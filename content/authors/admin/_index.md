I am an applied statistician and data scientist with over 15 years of research experience designing experiments, analysis plans, and custom models in collaboration with specialists in various disciplines (physics, ecology, genetics, economics). I have developed a specific expertise in the use of Bayesian analysis to combine mechanistic and empirical models, and to integrate evidence from disparate sources of data.
